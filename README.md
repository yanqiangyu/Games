This is the java source code for a Hearts-like card game called Pig-Chase.

The Simple test program is available as

	com.ialogic.games.cards.CardPlayTest

Input 4 player names and the test program will simulate a team game up to 100 rounds or when either team's score goes over +/- 1000.

Simple Server based test program, it listens to port 8080 and clients can connect to it using putty or any telnet client

Browser based client is under development. You are welcome to contribute to it.
HTML5 + a sever side java is done. User management and multiple room game play is underway.

04/20/2020	I have the basic client HTML5 and JS framework and a basic java HTTP server proxy through Apache
05/02/2020      Finally it is ready for multiplayer. Auto play is still glitch.

Have fun!
