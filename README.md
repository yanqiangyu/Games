This is the java source code for a Hearts-like card game called Pig-Chase. (中文：拱猪)

The Simple test program is available as

	com.ialogic.games.cards.CardPlayTest

Input 4 player names and the test program will simulate a team game up to 100 rounds or when either team's score is over +/-1000.

HTML5 + and server side java is done. User management and multiple room game play is underway.
Created issues list to keep track of things to do.
For a demo:

	http://www.ialogic.com/

Leave the player name blank and enter "test" to see the demo and check your browser compatibility. Latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox should work fine on all devices. I personally don't like IE or Edge. 


04/20/2020	I have the basic client HTML5 and JS framework and a basic java HTTP server proxy through Apache
05/02/2020      Finally it is ready for multiplayer. Auto play is still glitch.
05/02/2020      Test run with friends.


Have fun!
