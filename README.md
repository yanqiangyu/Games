This is the java source code for a Hearts-like card game called Pig-Chase.

The main test program is available as

	com.ialogic.games.cards.CardPlayTest

Input 4 player names and the test program will simulate a team game up to 100 rounds or when the either team's score goes over +/- 1000.

Online server and browser based client are under development. You are welcome to contribute to it.

Have fun!
